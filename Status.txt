Peer review is a process used to evaluate the quality, validity, and reliability of work—most commonly academic research, scientific studies, or professional documents—before it is published or accepted.

In professional or workplace contexts, peer review can also refer to colleagues reviewing each other’s work (like technical documents, reports, or code) to ensure quality, consistency, and correctness before it reaches a wider audience.

👉 In short: Peer review is a quality-control process where experts check each other’s work to ensure it meets required standards before acceptance or publication.

Agile Methodology
>>>
Agile is an Iterative Software Development Methodology that promotes collaboration and process adaptability throughout the project.  The Agile methodology promotes the continuous interaction of the development and testing during the SDLC process of any project.  This methodology allows much communication between the customers, developers, testers, and managers.
Different Frameworks are in Agile.
	Scrum – (For Development Projects) Scrum is simple and powerful framework for Teams and allows teams of people to develop complex products in environments of uncertainty and change. 
	Kanban – (Maintenance and Support Projects) Kanban is a workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services that delivers knowledge work. It helps you to visualize your work


The Waterfall Model is a linear application development model that uses rigid phases: When one phase ends, the next begins. Steps occur in sequence, and, if unmodified, the model does not allow developers to go back to previous steps (hence “waterfall”: Once water falls down, it cannot go back up).
